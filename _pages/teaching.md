During my PhD, I was involved in teaching the following courses:


**Deep Learning Lab** (2023-2025)

I co-organized the master-level course "Deep Learning Lab" at the University of Kassel, Germany. The course introduced students to deep learning fundamentals before progressing to specialized applications in bioacoustics, combining theoretical foundations with hands-on implementation projects.
