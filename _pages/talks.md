I had the pleasure of conducting a full-day workshop titled "Deep Learning with Humans-In-The-Loop: Active Learning for NLP" on July 4th, 2024. This event was part of the [BERD Academy by BERD@NFDI](https://www.berd-nfdi.de/berd-academy/active-learning-2024/). The workshop introduced participants to the concepts of Human-In-The-Loop Learning and (Deep) Active Learning with LLMs. [More details about the workshop can be found here.](https://www.berd-nfdi.de/berd-academy/active-learning-2024/)
